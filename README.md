# Frank the Science Bot
Frank is a bot who does science. He lives in the future.

Frank's job is to look at big data bases and find patterns. All patterns should be on the form f(x) = 0, where x is a data point (usually a vector) and f is a function. Frank finds functions. 

Frank's still a work in progress.
